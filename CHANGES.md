# Changelog

## v1.0.5

- Allows using Dup with Docker 1.13.x.

## v1.0.4

- Fixes incorrect `VIRTUAL_HOST` env-var for the web-container when using the default

## v1.0.3

- Removes the bindings between `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `hostname` (`-h` in the `docker run`) for the web container. This fixes the incorrect hostname format when a composite `VIRTUAL_HOST` is passed in via `env`

## v1.0.2

- Fixes a bug in v1.0.1 which broke "dup build"

## v1.0.1
- Fixes a bug in v1.0.0 which broke "dup up"

## v1.0.0
- Adds shell quoting to improve security of how Docker commands are executed
- Prints the full "docker build â€¦" command run for a "dup build"

## v1.0.0-RC5
- Supports optional "image" setting in "db" config for PostgreSQL containers only. The "image" setting can specify a custom Docker image name/tag for the database container.

## v1.0.0-RC4

- Fixed bug where `dup up` on an "uninitialised" project that has `"type": "none"` would fail

## v1.0.0-RC3

- Merged fix from Albert; typo in the `up` command string
- Added test harness to start building out tests
- Added tests for `docker.parseVersionStr`
- Added TravisCI support
- Fixed issue #17, version string parsing with beta Docker versions

## v1.0.0-RC2

- Removes need for `.up.state` file
- Fixes `VIRTUAL_HOST` bug
- Adds `docker version` check

## v1.0.0-RC1

- Massive refactoring of the core code. Properly setup in modules, properly typed with full compile-time checking and checked exception types.
- Supports easy addition of new database types now
- Code is now more robust, with proper error checking, and is now easier to test
- Now respects `VIRTUAL_HOST` correctly, setting the hostname to the defined `env` value (if not specified, it still defaults to `<name>.docker`), resolving [issue #10](/girvo/dup/issues/10)
- Database now supports `mongo` as a type parameter, with data-volume container handling for persistence
 - This does not take any kind of config currently, merely: `"type": "mongodb"`
- Added `dup logs [web|db]` command
 - Runs in "follow" mode, press Ctrl-C to stop viewing logs

## v0.4.0

- Fixes broken `dup build`
- Makes `dup status` actually check the result of `docker inspect` to ensure the container is actually running

## v0.3.12

Changed the `env` build argument to be `develop` to match Studio None's internal infrastructure.

Added `buildArgs` option to `.up.json`, follows the same format as `env` but is passed as a `--build-arg name=value` pair when `dup build` is executed.

## v0.3.11

This release fixes the issues with orphan containers caused by a missing flag in the `docker rm` command, run with `dup down`.

This release also adds basic support for `dup status`, to check whether the web and database containers are running.

## v0.3.10

This release added support for the official PostgreSQL Docker image, to allow the usage of version 9.5 (for it's `jsonb` support). In the future, you will be able to specify which point release of PostgreSQL your project needs.

## v0.3.7

The main new feature in v0.3.7 is the addition of `--build-arg env=dev` to the `dup build` command. This is a temporary measure until I expose build-args to the user via the `.up.json` file. This feature means you **need** to have this line in your base `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
ARG env
```

This is the bare minimum. You will likely want to instead do the following:

```Dockerfile
ARG env=prod
```

This will default the argument to `prod`, and fix the `One or more build-args [env] were not consumed, failing build.` error that will otherwise be triggered. An example of how to leverage this feature to allow for a singular production `Dockerfile` that has developer tools added on top, assuming two files: `conf/start.prod.sh` which is the standard entry-point, and `conf/start.dev.sh` which is the development entry-point that adds extra tools is as follows:

```Dockerfile
###
# This is both a test of Skate as a tool, as well as build-args for Docker
##
FROM studionone/node6:latest

# Use a different entrypoint for development vs production
ARG env=prod
ADD conf/start.$env.sh /start.sh
RUN chmod +x /start.sh

ADD code /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT /start.sh
```
